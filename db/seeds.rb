# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  books = Book.create([{ title: "Star Wars",author:"bafra" }, { title: "Lord of the Rings",author:"mayanja" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
